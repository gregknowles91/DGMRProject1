# DGMRProject1
For Project 1

Our project was based on insights into crime data across the US. We sought to understand the trends for property crime, violent crime, TX vs National averages, and worked to determine what we gathered from our data exercise. 

We found that crime generally falls when there are advances in technology and when people are more home based to prevent more burgularies, larceny, etc. 

We found that COVID was an accelerator/decelerator with crime, we often saw crime drop intensely or start a precursor to a spike. 

Technology, social change, massive world events/movements, and more home presence lead to changes in the trend of crime as a whole.
